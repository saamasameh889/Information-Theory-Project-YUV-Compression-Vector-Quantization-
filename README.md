# YUV Vector Quantization Image Compression

This project demonstrates image compression using **Vector Quantization (VQ)** in the **YUV color space**, with subsampling of chrominance channels and a fixed codebook for quantization.

## üîç Methodology

### 1. **Color Space Conversion**
- Convert RGB images to **YUV**.
- Subsample **U and V channels** to 50% width and height to exploit chrominance sensitivity.

### 2. **Vector Quantization**
- Divide Y, U, and V channels into **2x2 blocks**.
- Flatten each block into a vector and use **K-Means clustering** to generate a **codebook** of 256 vectors.
- Replace blocks with the nearest codebook index.

### 3. **Compression**
- Store the indices of vectors instead of full image data.
- Store the subsampled U and V channels at lower resolution.

### 4. **Decompression**
- Reconstruct each image from the quantized indices and codebook.
- Upsample U and V channels.
- Convert back to RGB for display.

## üìà Results Summary

### üü™ YUV Vector Quantization (with U/V subsampling)

- **Average PSNR**: 23.74 dB  
- **Average SSIM**: 0.9784  
- **Average Compression Ratio**: 8.09:1

### üü® Vector Quantization (RGB, no subsampling)

- **Average PSNR**: 26.65 dB  
- **Average SSIM**: 0.9799  
- **Average Compression Ratio**: 4.03:1

> Subsampling improves compression ratio significantly, at the cost of a slight drop in image quality.
